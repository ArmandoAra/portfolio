Four years ago, I began my programming journey through online courses, starting with Python and exploring from the basics of HTML and CSS to more advanced frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Tkinter. Over time, I discovered new learning platforms like Udemy, Platzi, and Coursera, which allowed me to expand my stack with modern technologies: JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Git/GitHub, SQL and NoSQL databases, along with solid foundations in software engineering. Recently, I completed the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate (Coursera), where I built practical projects with React, applied UX/UI principles, and developed a capstone project that integrated all my learning.",
